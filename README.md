Diabetes Prediction Using Different algorithms :Linear regression:

Now a days due to hectic schedules, Sedentary lifestyle people do not follow the proper diet. Poor diet may lead to the diabetes disease and also which may cause several fatal health issues like heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, nerve damage etc. When diabetes is early detected with high accuracy, it can be effectively treated. If this occurs, the patient is required to visit a diagnostic center for their report. As a result, they have to invest time and money every time. But with the growth of Machine Learning methods, we have got the flexibility to search out an answer to the current issue, by using machine learning model. In this study, the objective is to develop an accurate system that could predict diabetes risk levels in a patient. Early diabetes detection and prediction can be greatly improved with machine learning (ML) approaches. The goal of this examination of the diagnosis of diabetes by different supervised ML algorithms and Eight algorithms are compared to figure out which is the best.
